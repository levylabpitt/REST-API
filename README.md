### HTTPS-LV-PS-Bridge ###
This is a framework to perform HTTPS requests using Windows PowerShell, which has more request options than LabVIEW natively supports. This is done by programmatically creating a PowerShell script in LabVIEW, saving it, running it, and then deleting the script. The method used in PowerShell is `Invoke-WebRequst`.

#### Supported Methods ####

Supported methods include **GET**, **PUT**, **DELETE**, **PATCH**, **HEAD**, **PATCH Multipart**, and **POST Multipart**. This list will grow slightly in the future.
